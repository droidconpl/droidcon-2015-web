I like Open Source projects. I'm a big fan of a lot of fancy Android libraries out there and I contribute with bug reporting, fixing and feedbacks.\n\nI approached Reactive Programming in 2013 and I started using it in Android thanks to RxJava by Netflix. I'm using it in every Android app I work on since then, because RxJava solves so many issues on Android and it gives you a new perspective about mobile programming.\n\nIn 2013 I co-founded Alter Ego, a mobile and embedded solutions company. In 2015 I published RxJava Essentials for Packt Publishing. I'm currently writing Grokking Rx for Manning Publishing. ",
