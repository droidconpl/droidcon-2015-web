It drastically changed the way to handle permissions from the previous mechanism.<br /><br />The change is basically great for users but also the hell for developers. Because developers have to write a ton of boilerplate codes and the new mechanism and api may not be easy for developers.<br /><br />### For example<br />- `shouldShowRationale` is a really confusing method<br />- There is a lot of class which have methods about permissions, PermissionChecker, ContextCompat, ActivityCompat, FragmentCompat, etc...<br /><br />So in this session, I'm gonna talk about what actually the change is and how to manage permissions well. And I'm also gonna introduce the usage of my library \"PermissionsDispatcher\", which solves the problem that writing a ton of boilerplate codes.<br /><br />https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher", "Developing for Android has drastically changed over the last few years.<br />We now have a gigantic toolbox we can benefit from to improve our productivity and build better applications.<br /><br />During this presentation I will introduce some of the tools we use daily at happn, a multi-million users French dating application.<br /><br />I will talk about many tools that help us to:<br />- Simulate a laggy/instable HTTP(s) connection<br />- Interact with our application to analyze logs, views, and modify any data (inc. memory / shared preferences / database) in real time<br />- Change our application's backend server without recompiling<br />- Better understand our technical debt<br />- Create a REST mock server in a few seconds to anticipate the development of a feature when the backend is not developed yet<br />- Measure the performance (cpu/memory) of our application<br />- Decompile our application to better understand and analyze its security<br />- Alter a server response and check whether the application behaves properly<br />- and many more tips..."]
